# knowledgeGraph
all documentation to build from scratch an incremenal and impactless knowledge graph (KG)

Maybe the first step should be to clarify with a good reference what is a KG. 
[This is the reference book for all of us](https://www.poolparty.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/the-knowledge-graph-cookbook.pdf)

We will use also [a collaborative bookmark](https://web.hypothes.is/) to share links and to underline links. Make your own accout.

We will use also [a conference tool via browser](https://meet.jit.si/)
We will use also [a conference tool via android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jitsi.meet&hl=it&gl=US)
We will use also [a conference tool via iphone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jitsi-meet/id1165103905)
The room name is 'graphminds'.


Hereinafter the list of the steps to switch to search things not strings paradigm:

1. [Graph Modelling and Taxonomy](./graph_modelling.md)

2. [Ingestion and pre-ingestion](./graph_modelling.md)
