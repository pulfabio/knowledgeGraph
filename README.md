# knowledgeGraph
This repo aims to document how to build from scratch knowledge graph (KG) using as much as 
possible open technologies (open standard - open source - open data) that is agnostic (domain independent) and could be built on top of present enterprise technology an incremenal and impactless way.

The project is inspired by [Google Knowledge Graph](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-knowledge-graph/369484/)
and also [Wolfran Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/tour/)


## On boarding steps

1. To read our [reference book](https://www.poolparty.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/the-knowledge-graph-cookbook.pdf) what is a KG.

2. To make your own accout [a collaborative bookmark](https://web.hypothes.is/) to share links and to underline links and be member of the group. - All links here - not anymore via slacks ...

3. Async Comm between the group - [make accout slack and join](https://graphthinking.slack.com/) 

4. Sync Comm get acquainted with jitsi meet a [conference tool via browser](https://meet.jit.si/) or [via android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jitsi.meet&hl=it&gl=US) or [via iphone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jitsi-meet/id1165103905) where the room name is **graphminds**. Generally we meet 6pm Paris Time on sunday.

5. To contribute we use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/)
and [this is a site to train yourself on plantuml](https://www.planttext.com/) with some style and conventions.
