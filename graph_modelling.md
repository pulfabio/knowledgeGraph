# Graph Modelling

We try to model all the knowledge around a domain with the maximum degree of granularity as a graph.


We segment a topic with a taxonomy 

The segmentation is extra is the taxonomy refers to the entity as a whole (for example for musical instruments extra taxonomy is to segment between clarinet, guitar etc...), while intra taxonomy is to segment pieces of a clarinet or of a trumpet.

A further classification is context of the item (for example a case fof a guitar).


The items are modelled with descriptive (image, short test description), categorical (status: used, new) and quantitative features (size, weigth, price).


Conventions:

to label the nodes we use CamelCase (example Products), to label the edges we use camelCase (example hasImage).
